  <h1>HTML Structure</h1>
    <p>HTML documents are just plain text files that will only appear styled when viewed with a browser.</p>
  <h2>Identifying Elements</h2>
    <p>HTML uses special text keywords called <em>elements</em> to structure and style a website.  The browser recognizes an element and applies its effect if the following three conditions exist:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>The element is a letter, word, or phrase with special meaning.  For example, <em>h1</em> is an element recognized by the browser to apply a header effect, with bold text ang an enlarged font size.</li>
        <li>The element is enclosed with a left-angle bracket (<) and right-angle bracket (>).  An element enclosed in this way is called a <em>tag</em>(such as, for example, <em>h1</em>).</li>
        <li>An opening tag (< element >) is followed by a closing tag (< /element >).  Note that the closing tag differs from the opening tag by the addition of a forward slash after the first left bracket and before the element(such as, for example, < /h1 >).</li>
     </ol>
  <p>When all three conditions are met, the text between the opening and closing tags is styled with the tag's defined effect.  If even one of these conditions is not met, the browser just displays plain text.</p>
<h2>Attributes in HTML Documents</h2>
  <p> <em>Attributes</em> provide additional ways to modify the behavior of an element or specify additional information.  Usually, but not always, you set an attribute equal to a value enclosed in quotes.</p>
  <p> <strong>Keep the following rules in mind when using attributes:</strong> </p>
    <ul>
      <li>If using an attribute, always include the attribute in the opening HTML tag.</li>
      <li>Multiple attributes can modify a single element.</li>
      <li>If the attribute has a value, then use the equal sign (=) and enclose the value in quotes.</li>
    </ul>
